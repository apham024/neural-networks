# Introduction
This is my modified version of the given code from ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"]. This program is given a training data size of 50,000 of handwritten digits. The neural networks recognize the patterns for the same digit in different handwritings and classifies and categorizes them by adjusting its accuracy each run. With this program, it runs the neural networks by epoch and number of models and exports it into a .csv file. With a separate file, it reads in that data and plots the neural network accuracy as the y-axis and the number of epochs it ran as the x-axis. Feel free to play around with the number of hidden units, mini-batches, and learning rates. At the end of the program, it should have maximized its understanding of the patterns of the test data of handwritten digits.
